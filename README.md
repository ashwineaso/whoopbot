## Overview

Whoopbot provides a virtual lock on your resources, so that it's used by one person at a time.

This is useful in cases where multiple people are working on the same resource,
and you need to ensure that it's locked from being modified by anyone else.

For example: You are working on a service: `api-service` which has to be deployed on the `staging` environment.
To ensure that no one else would deploy their version of the service to the same environment,
you can lock the resource using `/whoop lock api-service staging`.

Please note that this is a virtual lock, does not prevent the person from actually modifying the resource.

## Usage Instructions

Whoopbot has the following functionality:

1. Add a resource for a specific environment
2. Delete a resource for a specific environment
3. List the resource and their environments
4. List the locked resources and their environments
5. Lock a resource for a specific environment
6. Unlock a resource for a specific environment

### Adding a Resource

You can add a resource using the command: `/whoop add <resource> <environment:optional>`.  
The environment is optional, if you don't specify it, will be set as `Default`.

You can add the same resource multiple times, but with different environments.
```sh
/whoop add api-service
/whoop add api-service staging
```

### Deleting a Resource

You can remove a resource using the command: `/whoop delete <resource> <environment:optional>`.  
The environment is optional, if you don't specify it, will be set as `Default`.

### Listing Resources:

Resources which have been added are listed using the command: `/whoop list resources`.

### Listing Locked Resources:

Resources which have been added are listed using the command: `/whoop list locked resources`.

### Locking a Resource
